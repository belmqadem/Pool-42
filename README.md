## Introduction

This repository documents my journey through the 42 coding school pool days. The pool is a challenging yet rewarding experience where participants showcase their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Pool Structure

The 42 pool is an intensive coding challenge designed to assess and enhance participants' programming skills. It spans over 14 days, labeled from C00 to C13. Each day focuses on specific topics, building a foundation for a comprehensive understanding of programming concepts. Here's a detailed breakdown of the pool structure:

1. **C00 - C02: Introduction to C Programming**
   - Basic syntax and programming concepts in the C language.
   - Introduction to data types, variables, and control structures.

2. **C03 - C05: More C Concepts**
   - Arrays, strings, and pointers.
   - Functions and modular programming.

3. **C06 - C09: Advanced C Programming**
   - Memory allocation and dynamic data structures.
   - File I/O and advanced topics in C.

4. **C10 - C13: Algorithmic and Data Structure Challenges**
   - Sorting algorithms and their implementations.
   - Linked lists, stacks, queues, and other data structures.
   - Advanced problem-solving and algorithmic challenges.

The pool encourages a hands-on, collaborative approach to learning, emphasizing practical coding exercises and peer-to-peer interaction. Participants are expected to solve challenges individually and contribute to the collective learning experience.
